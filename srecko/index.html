    <h2> Srećko the Dog </h2>
      <p>
        Srecko has been my pet for many years, but he is more than that. He is also one of my closest friends and even an anchor during dark times. His name is pronounced as Sreh-chko, as it is a Serbian name. It roughly translates to happy,
        or he who is happy. He was given the name as it sounded cute but also describes him very well. As he is always full of energy and ready for an adventure.

        <h3> His early days </h3>
        <p>
          Back in the dark ages, or also known as 2013, my sisters and our grandma were strolling through the town of Obrenovac in Serbia. Where they saw a man walking his pekingese dog. My sisters were immediatly stunned and wanted to pet the adorable
          dog. When our grandma inquired about the dog she found out that the man was in fact a certified pekingese breeder, and that soon he will have a new batch of pups if they were interested. My grandma originally thought my sisters would forget about
          the pups, but they did nothing but ask her about them nearly daily. Eventually the fated day came, and Srecko was blessed onto our family. From his early days he was always pampered and treated with nothing but love. He would sleep in our beds,
          be given small scraps and treats, and always held as a baby.
