      <h2>A bit about me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a current undergraduate student in the ITM program of IIT.
        Born and raised in sweet home Chicago, Illinois.
      </p>
      <h3> Aside from being from Chicago, I have other interesting qualities as well. </h3>
        <p>
          I lived in Europe for a good few years, where I finished High School and got a degree in Mechatronics.
          I spent a great deal of time on my computer where I always enjoyed tinkering with it, expanding it, or doing
          whacky things with it just for fun. Thus my interest in ITM as a whole. I was able to retain and continue
          expanding on my English even while spending a lot of time in a non-English speaking country due to this
          and spending a lot of time playing video games online with friends.
        </p>
          <h4> My time in Europe. </h4>
            <p>I moved to Europe around the age of 10. Where I lived to the end of highschool. I finished a Mechatronics degree, and because of
            which makes me a certified technician of Mechatronics. I took courses out of a variety of subjects relating to the discipline.
            Such as:
              <ol>
                <li>Electrical Engineering</li>
                <li>Mechanical Engineering</li>
                <li>Hydraulics & Pneumonics</li>
                <li>Beginner Java Programming</li>
                <li>Control Systems</li>
                <li>Technical Drawing (By hand and CAD)</li>
              </ol>
              It was an extremely unique experience where I gained a lot of experience as well.
              Due to the fact I also assisted our head professor in a variety of tasks around the school.
              Such as helping setup the schools Wi-Fi network, prepare class materials prior to start of class, and work on the school websites database.
              It was these activities that made me realise I was more suited for ITM work, rather than engineering. It is also a field I have
              much more passion for.
            </p>
          <h3> Some games I played throughout my years (and even maybe now!) </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>World of Warcraft (Since I was 4!)</li>
            <li>Minecraft</li>
            <li>Payday 2</li>
            <li>Overwatch</li>
            <li>Team Fortress 2</li>
          </ul>
