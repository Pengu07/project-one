      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a current undergraduate student in the ITM program of IIT.
        Born and raised in sweet home Chicago, Illinois.
      </p>
      <h3> Aside from being from Chicago, I have other interesting qualities as well. </h3>
        <p>
          I lived in Europe for a good few years, where I finished High School and got a degree in Mechatronics.
          I spent a great deal of time on my computer where I always enjoyed tinkering with it, expanding it, or doing
          whacky things with it just for fun. Thus my interest in ITM as a whole. I was able to retain and continue
          expanding on my English while growing up due to this and spending a lot of time playing video games online with friends.
          </p>

          <h3> Some games I played throughout my years (and even maybe now!) </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>World of Warcraft (Since I was 4!)</li>
            <li>Minecraft</li>
            <li>Payday 2</li>
            <li>Overwatch</li>
            <li>Team Fortress 2</li>
          </ul>
