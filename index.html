      <h2>A bit about me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a current undergraduate student in the ITM program of IIT.
        Born and raised in sweet home Chicago, Illinois.
      </p>
      <h3> Aside from being from Chicago, I have other interesting qualities as well. </h3>
        <p>
          I lived in Europe for a good few years, where I finished High School and got a degree in Mechatronics.
          I spent a great deal of time on my computer where I always enjoyed tinkering with it, expanding it, or doing
          whacky things with it just for fun. Thus my interest in ITM as a whole. I was able to retain and continue
          expanding on my English even while spending a lot of time in a non-English speaking country due to this
          and spending a lot of time playing video games online with friends.
        </p>
          <h4> My time in Europe. </h4>
            <p>
              I moved to Europe around the age of 10. Where I lived to the end of highschool. I finished a Mechatronics degree, and because of
              which makes me a certified technician of Mechatronics. I took courses out of a variety of subjects relating to the discipline.
              Such as:
              <ol>
                <li>Electrical Engineering</li>
                <li>Mechanical Engineering</li>
                <li>Hydraulics & Pneumonics</li>
                <li>Beginner Java Programming</li>
                <li>Control Systems</li>
                <li>Technical Drawing (By hand and CAD)</li>
              </ol>
              It was an extremely unique experience where I gained a lot of experience as well.
              Due to the fact I also assisted our head professor in a variety of tasks around the school.
              Such as helping setup the schools Wi-Fi network, prepare class materials prior to start of class, and work on the school websites database.
              It was these activities that made me realise I was more suited for ITM work, rather than engineering. It is also a field I have
              much more passion for.
            </p>
          <h4> My interest in computers </h4>
            <p>
              My interest in computers started from a young age, from as far back as I can remember really. I would watch my dad work on repairing computers,
              tinkering with them, and using them for a variety of tasks. I was always fascinated with them, and that fascination grew to a
              passion to working on computers that persists to today. While growing up I always spent time on my parents computers where I would
              use them for a variety of things. Nothing too special. But as I got older I spent more time doing more difficult tasks. I self taught
              myself through the process of installing a variety of Linux distributions, designing scripts and small programs, and video editing.
              Along with spending a decent chunk of time gaming, as is the usual these days.
            </p>
            <h5> Video Editing </h5>
              <p>
                Video editing was always something more of a hobby of mine. At around 8 I recieved a digital camera, and I immediatly started recording
                random clips from my daily life and try to make them funny or entertaining. I have some of those little videos even uploaded to youtube
                on an account I can no longer access! Not my proudest moment...
              </p>
              <p>
                Anyway. While I spent time gaming with my friends I would save 5 minute clips from random things that we found funny or mischief
                we would find ourselves in. After which I would then assemble said clips into compilation videos for me and my friends to watch and enjoy
                having some of our finest memories recorded and assembled into videos we can all look back on. They started simple, nothing more than
                just clips spliced together. But, as it went on I spent more time on the actual editing. Some examples of things I worked on would be:
                <ul>
                  <li>Music in the background</li>
                  <li>Easy to read subtitles</li>
                  <li>A modern looking opening animation</li>
                  <li>Clips flowing into each other for a more cohesive feel</li>
                  <li>Better cuts</li>
                </ul>
                I constantly strive to improve my editing and these are just some things I worked on.My video editing has slowed down in recent
                years as I focus on other projects, but I do look forward to when I can go back to working on some new videos.
              </p>
          <h3> Some games I played throughout my years (and even maybe now!) </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>World of Warcraft (Since I was 4!)</li>
            <li>Minecraft</li>
            <li>Payday 2</li>
            <li>Overwatch</li>
            <li>Team Fortress 2</li>
          </ul>
